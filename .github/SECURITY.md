## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities should be reported to [Sandboxed Thoughts](mailto:admin@sandboxedthoughts.com?subject=vulnerability&ensp;found&ensp;in&ensp;sandboxed-thoughts/jsc-order-tracking)

Include:

- vulnerability type
- associated code block
- fixes (if any)
- if you would like to be notified of status changes
- if a PR has already been submitted to resolve the vulnerability
- any additional information that may help expedite a resolution

## How we respond

Submitting a vulnerability may not necessarily warrant a response from our end. If it is a matter that requires additional information we may reply with a request for more information. If you would like to get feedback or a status update on our progress, feel free to let us know.

If you would like to submit a pull request to fix the issue, please use the bug report template and name the pull request in a discrete manner. Do not include the words 'vulnerability', 'security', or any other reference to the system being compromised. This is to protect escalation of the vulnerability, current users, and affected information.

A full report with credit to the persons responsible for finding and fixing the vulnerability will be made available after a resolution has been implemented.
